## Description: 

         In this project we use Handlebars and mySQL to create a simple app where you can add burgers you would like to eat to a list and then virtually eat them, YUM!!!

## Installation:

         For this project there is a Heroku link which will allow it to run like a web page. Simply open the heroku link and use the site.

## Usage:

         Upon opening the app you will see a screen where you have buttong and inputs to enter the name of a new burger that you would like to eat or to devour a burger in your list. Simply follow the prompts and enjoy.
